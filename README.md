# Web-Scraping

I am planning on building some web scraping projects to enhance my data science skills. I will be uploading codes into this repo for them.

## LinkedIn Connection Scraping

### Technologies
* Python 3.8
* Selenium
* Beautiful Soup

I used selenium to navigate through my personal linkedin page looking for connections. An initial loop goes through all connection storing theri profile urls into a queue. After that, I used beautiful soup to extract information including current role, location, past job experiences, etc.
